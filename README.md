# Simple Color picker for iOS 

Implemented with Swift, this is a simple application that 
1. choose a color inside a bounding box of size nxn at a given position
2. display that color as background of the text label
3. display the inverse of that color as the text color. 

code are really self explanatory and therefore not a lot of comments were there.
